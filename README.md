**URL Detection System**
**"Protecting Your Online Identity, One Click at a Time."**

**üìñ Description**
=====================================================

The URL Detection System is a web-based application designed to detect phishing URL attempts in real-time. This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze URLs and determine whether they are genuine or malicious. The system is built using Python and Flask, with a user-friendly interface that provides accurate results.

The system is trained on a dataset of known phishing(url) and legitimate URLs, allowing it to learn patterns and characteristics that distinguish between the two. The model is then used to classify new URLs as phishing or legitimate, providing users with a safer browsing experience.

**‚ú® Features**
=====================================================

1. **Machine Learning Model**: The system uses a machine learning model trained on a dataset of known phishing and legitimate URLs to detect phishing attempts.
2. **Real-time Analysis**: The system analyzes URLs in real-time, providing users with immediate results.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: The system features a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to easily input URLs and view results.
4. **Accurate Results**: The system provides accurate results, minimizing the risk of misclassification.
5. **Web-Based**: The system is accessible via a web browser, making it easy to use and accessible from anywhere.
6. **Customizable**: The system allows users to customize the detection settings to suit their needs.
7. **CSV Output**: The system outputs results in CSV format, making it easy to analyze and visualize data.
8. **Error Handling**: The system includes error handling to ensure that it continues to function even in the event of unexpected errors.
